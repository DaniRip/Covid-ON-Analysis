# Covid-ON-Analysis
Very quick code written for plotting testing, positivity and % positivity rates for COVID-19 Cases in Ontario
Description of the project/use of the output images in my medium article: https://medium.com/@dripsman/covid-19-cases-in-ontario-right-now-6a6c33e8d8a3

Note that it was written sort of ad-hoc for Ontario visualization, but can be adjusted to match dates and visualize just about any region where data is available.
